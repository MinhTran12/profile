# Book Buddy

Book Buddy is a tree-shaped smart bookmark created to enhance the users' reading experience through tracking reading goals and connecting fellow readers.

The project followed an user-centered design approach using the Triple Design Diamond method. The core idea of the framework is to split the design process into workable phases while enabling diverging thoughts and ideas at the beginning of each step before convergence.

## Discovery and Defining

First we discovered and defined the scope of our product: what is something that the people want and how we can achieve it. Concept mapping was used to come up with potential ideas between the team members before we synthesized them and rated them based on feasibility, novelty, and "enchantibility". Choosing the bookmark as our core object, we then created various items such as user personas and story boards to explore the user needs while further narrowing down the main functionalities.

## Prototyping and Development

With the design semi-refined, we proceeded with prototyping. The team began with low fidelity prototyping, where we were most concerned about how the bookmark should look and function. A touchscreen was proposed for displaying information, but the team favored a more nature-themed aesthetic. This led us to designing a tree-shaped bookmark with the following features:

- Track the user's reading goals active reading friends using the LED lights.
- Detect when the book is open or closed, with haptic feedback to let the user know when their friends open their books.
- A mobile application connected to the device using bluetooth for personalization, setting goals, and managing books and friend contacts.

For the high-fidelity prototype, we put together various eletronic components and 3D printed parts. In addition, we programmed the behaviour of the bookmark as well as the companion app. Given the feedback from the volunteers on the lowfi prototype and various compromises made during the construction, the final result looked visually different yet still retained the core functionalities.

## Validation

Two main user studies were done at different stages. We conducted a vignette study using the lowfi prototype along with crafted scenarios, user personas, and storyboards mentioned previously to evaluate the prototype's effectiveness as well as gather users' early feedback. For the second study, participants were observed interacting with Book Buddy, and then were interviewed to understand their thought processes. We found avid readers appreciated the social aspect and the enchantment of bookmark, while new readers saw the goal tracking feature to be motivating.
