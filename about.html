              I'm Minh Nhat Tran, or Trần Nhật Minh as it is known in
              Vietnamese. Nowadays I usually go by Minh Tran and Minh for short.
            </p>
            <p>
              Born and raised in Hanoi, Vietnam, I got my Computer Science
              bachelor degree with a minor in Psychology at University of
              Minnesota, Twin-Cities (Go Gophers!). I am currently living in the
              Netherlands as I complete my Master degree in Human-Computer
              Interaction at Utrecht University.
            </p>
            <p>
              My primary professional interests are in User Experience research
              and design, Artificial Intelligence, and Data
              Analytics/Visualization. More specifically, I am passionate about
              user centric design: ensuring intuitive and accessible interaction
              between people and machines, utilizing data-driven insights while
              making such data easy to understand in the first place, and
              advocating for explainable and ethical AI usage.
            </p>
            <p>
              On a more personal note, my hobbies include reading (usualy
              novels, comics, and historical non-fiction), and playing video
              games (mostly single-player ones) to name a few. I recommend the
              Mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson if you want to get into
              fantasy novels, and Disco Elysium for those who want a novel
              disguised as a cRPG.
