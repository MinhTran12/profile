            The four mandatory courses have allowed me to learn the fundamentals
            of the Human Computer Interaction field. Advance cognitive and
            social psychology for HCI for example helped me cover a wide ranges
            of relevant psychological topics pertaining to computer science.
            While I had minored in Psychology during my bachelor year, the
            psychological knowledge that I gained from this course not only
            reinforced what I have already known, but also introduced me to how
            certain psychological concepts are applied in the context of
            technology. The courses on research methods are illuminating, and I
            learned a lot; I had done researches before, but as a Master
            student, the demand for a more rigorous scientific process from what
            I was used to is very prevalent, which then pushed me to go above
            and beyond. Also, Interaction technology innovation was surprisingly
            fun and informative. As I have a background in computer science, I
            have limited knowledge on hardware, and so being able to work with
            controller chips, printing 3D objects, and soldering wires, I was
            able to apply what I know to new areas while learning new knowledge
            outside of my usual expertise.

            As I am interested in data driven insights, half of the electives I
            have taken revolves around data processing and visualization.
            Regardless of my specific interests, knowing how to process raw data
            and then present it in a meaningful and creative way is a great
            skill to have in any fields. While I am aware that there still many
            novel ways of approaching data, I can say that I am much better
            equipped at not only understanding complex data, but also helping
            others do the same. Education and machine learning are the two
            additional themes that I have delved into during my Master journey.
            I learned of how existing and new technologies are currently being
            integrated to education to help people learn more effectively, of
            which the process can be made fun and interactive depending on the
            methods applied. Machine learning techniques, while difficult to
            grasp at first, gave me ways to transform and model data in ways
            that the traditional approaches may not be capable of.

            What I really appreciate about these courses are that they are quite
            practical. There were still lots of theories to know about which was
            to be expected from a Master program, but the instructors
            incorporated a lot of real life examples as parts of the learning
            material. This really helped me with visualizing how I can apply
            what I learned to real-world scenarios, bridging the gap between
            theory and practice.
