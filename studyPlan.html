              The four mandatory courses in the HCI program have allowed me to
              learn the fundamentals of the Human-Computer Interaction field.
              Advanced courses in cognitive and social psychology for HCI, for
              example, helped me cover a wide range of relevant psychological
              topics related to computer science. While I had a minor in
              Psychology during my bachelor's years, the psychological knowledge
              gained from this course not only reinforced what I already knew
              but also introduced me to how certain psychological concepts are
              applied in the context of technology. The research methods courses
              were illuminating, and I learned a lot. Though I had done research
              before, as a Master's student, there was an expectation for a
              rigorous scientific process - more than I was used to - which
              pushed me to go above and beyond. Additionally, the course on
              Interaction Technology Innovation was surprisingly enjoyable and
              informative. With a background in computer science, my knowledge
              of hardware was limited, so being able to work with controller
              chips, print 3D objects, and solder wires allowed me to apply what
              I know to new areas while learning new knowledge outside of my
              usual expertise.

              As I am interested in data-driven insights, half of the electives
              I have taken revolve around data processing and visualization.
              Regardless of my specific interests, knowing how to process raw
              data and present it in a meaningful and creative way is a valuable
              skill in any field. While I am aware that there are still many
              novel ways of approaching data, I can confidently say that I am
              much better equipped not only to understand complex data but also
              to help others do the same. Education and machine learning are two
              additional themes that I explored during my Master's journey. I
              learned how existing and new technologies are integrated into
              education to enhance learning effectiveness, sometimes making the
              process fun and interactive depending on the methods applied.
              Although machine learning techniques were initially challenging to
              grasp, they provided me with ways to transform and model data in
              ways that traditional approaches may not be capable of.

              What I particularly appreciate about these courses is their
              practicality. While there were plenty of theories to learn, as
              expected in a Master's program, the instructors incorporated many
              real-life examples into the learning materials. This greatly aided
              me in visualizing how I could apply what I learned to real-world
              scenarios, bridging the gap between theory and practice.
