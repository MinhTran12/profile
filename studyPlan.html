            The four mandatory courses in the HCI program have allowed me to
            learn the fundamentals of the Human-Computer Interaction field.
            Advanced courses in cognitive and social psychology for HCI, for
            example, helped me cover a wide range of relevant psychological
            topics related to computer science. While I had a minor in
            Psychology during my bachelor's years, the psychological knowledge
            gained from this course not only reinforced what I already knew but
            also introduced me to how certain psychological concepts are applied
            in the context of technology. The research methods courses were
            illuminating, and I learned a lot. Though I had done research
            before, as a Master's student, there was an expectation for a
            rigorous scientific process - more than I was used to - which pushed
            me to go above and beyond. Additionally, the course on Interaction
            Technology Innovation was surprisingly enjoyable and informative.
            With a background in computer science, my knowledge of hardware was
            limited, so being able to work with controller chips, print 3D
            objects, and solder wires allowed me to apply what I know to new
            areas while learning new knowledge outside of my usual expertise.

            As I am interested in data-driven insights, half of the electives I
            have taken revolve around data processing and visualization.
            Regardless of my specific interests, knowing how to process raw data
            and present it in a meaningful and creative way is a valuable skill
            in any field. While I am aware that there are still many novel ways
            of approaching data, I can confidently say that I am much better
            equipped not only to understand complex data but also to help others
            do the same. Education and machine learning are two additional
            themes that I explored during my Master's journey. I learned how
            existing and new technologies are integrated into education to
            enhance learning effectiveness, sometimes making the process fun and
            interactive depending on the methods applied. Although machine
            learning techniques were initially challenging to grasp, they
            provided me with ways to transform and model data in ways that
            traditional approaches may not be capable of.

            What I particularly appreciate about these courses is their
            practicality. While there were plenty of theories to learn, as
            expected in a Master's program, the instructors incorporated many
            real-life examples into the learning materials. This greatly aided
            me in visualizing how I could apply what I learned to real-world
            scenarios, bridging the gap between theory and practice.
